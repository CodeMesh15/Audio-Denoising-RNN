# Audio-Denoising-RNN
An implementation of a Deep Recurrent Gated Neural Network for dynamic audio denoising. The model learns to reconstruct a clean audio signal from a noise-corrupted input by estimating and subtracting the noise in the spectral domain, inspired by research at Carnegie Mellon University.
